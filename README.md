# data_structures
This is a repository to store all of my studies about Data Structures and Algorithms. Data Strucutres is a way to manage, organize, and perform data in computer memory with the best time and space complexity possible.

## All the Data Structures and features that I'm learning: 
- Recursion
- Arrays
- Strings
- Matrices and its operations
- Sparse Matrix and Polynomial Representation
- Linked Lists
- Sparse Matrix using Linke Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Search Trees
- Heap
- Sorting algorithms
- Hashing
- Graphs
- Asymptotic Notations

  <span>I'm using C++ to learn this data strucutres and watching to the course "Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C+", by Abdul Bari.</span>
